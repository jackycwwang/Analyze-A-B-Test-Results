# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
AB test for e-commerce website

Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project 3

In this project, we are going to create several different models to compare the results. First, we simulated the AB test using python. Then, we used the built-in function from statsmodels to obtain the result, compared it with the result from the simulation. Second, we created a model with logistic regression approach. Finally, we explored the logistic regression models with multi explanatory variables (categorical variables), and also explored higher order linear models - an interaction between two independent variables - to see if one factor depends on another factor.
